  class Report
    # Define an event handler for your report. The different events fired in a
    # report's life cycle are:
    #
    # :start::     Fired by the runner when starting the whole test suite.
    # :enter::     Fired by the runner when starting a particular test case. It
    #              will get the test case as an argument.
    # :test::      Fired by a test before it starts running. It will get the
    #              instance of TestCase for the given test as an argument.
    # :assertion:: Fired by a test each time an assertion is run.
    # :pass::      Fired by a test after it runs successfully without errors.
    #              It will get an instance of PassedTest as an argument.
    # :pending::   Fired by a test which doesn't provide a test block or which
    #              calls TestCase#pending. It will get an instance of
    #              PendingTest as an argument.
    # :failure::   Fired by a test in which an assertion failed. It will get an
    #              instance of FailedTest as an argument.
    # :error::     Fired by a test where an uncaught exception was found. It
    #              will get an instance of ErroredTest as an argument.
    # :exit::      Fired by the runner each time a test case finishes. It will
    #              take the test case as an argument.
    # :end::       Fired by the runner at the end of the whole test suite.
    #
    # The event handler will receive the report as a first argument, plus any
    # arguments documented above (depending on the event). It will also ensure
    # that any handler for the same event declared on an ancestor class is run.
